## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
An AI-powered mobile application and chatbot system designed specifically for small and marginal farmers in India. The platform will be multilingual and voice-enabled, supporting local dialects to overcome literacy and language barriers. The solution will integrate with weather APIs, soil health databases, and satellite data to provide real-time, hyperlocal advisory on:

Crop selection based on soil and weather

Fertilizer and pesticide usage guidance

Pest and disease identification using image analysis

Alerts for extreme weather conditions

Current market prices and best times to sell

Personalized suggestions based on crop history

The platform will also feature a feedback mechanism to gather data on usability and outcomes, ensuring continuous refinement of recommendations through AI/ML.
## Technical Approach
Technologies to be Used:

Frontend: React Native for cross-platform mobile app development

Backend: Node.js, Python (for AI/ML model integration)

Database: PostgreSQL, Firebase (for real-time data)

AI/ML: TensorFlow or PyTorch for image recognition and predictive modeling

APIs: OpenWeatherMap, Government soil and crop datasets, Mandis price APIs

Voice Integration: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech / Speech-to-Text in regional languages

Languages Supported: Punjabi, Hindi, and other regional languages
## Feasibility:

High mobile phone penetration in rural India ensures wide potential reach.

Availability of open government datasets and weather APIs supports data-driven advisory.

Local partnerships with NGOs, cooperatives, and Krishi Vigyan Kendras for ground-level training.

Challenges & Risks:

Digital literacy among farmers

Network availability in remote areas

Resistance to adoption due to trust issues

Mitigation Strategies:

Voice and icon-based interface

Offline access with periodic sync

Community ambassadors for awareness and trust-buildingFeasibility and Viability

## Impact and Benefits
Social Impact:

Empowers farmers with scientific decision-making tools

Reduces reliance on unverified or exploitative sources of advice

Improves agricultural knowledge and digital inclusion

Economic Impact:

Increased crop yields and profitability

Reduction in input costs due to optimized fertilizer/pesticide use

Better market timing and pricing decisions

Environmental Impact:

Promotes sustainable and precise chemical usage

Reduces overuse of harmful inputs

Encourages crop diversification and resilience
